					<h3>Finding simplicity in life</h3>
					<p>
						<span>Life can get complicated really quickly,</span> but it doesn't

						<h3>Simplicity and work</h3>
						<p>
							Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it
							ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By
							keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance
							everything out.

						<h3>Simple decorations</h3>
						<p>
							A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either
							don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the
							impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye
							where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
